## Evaluating the phylogenetics of collagen IV in early animal evolution

I performed BLAST of a nematostella collagen IV sequence and aligned sequences from many early animal taxa. 

```{r fig.width=10, fig.height=10}

# Insert code here to view the phylogeny
phy = read.tree("animal.alignment.fasta.treefile")
plot(phy)
nodelabels(phy$node.label)
```
